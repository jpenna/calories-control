# Calories Control - Web

Frontend of the Calories Control application.

It is a PWA that works offline for viewing only and can be installed on a mobile device.

There are no unit tests or e2e tests.
The environment is prepared but, because of time constraints and less priority on the requirements, I didn't work on it.
